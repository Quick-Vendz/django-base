You are generating a course description for my LMS. Follow these rules exactly:

1. Follow the template structure below with zero deviations.
2. Use the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC) or NCEA subject progression as the content source.
3. Match the tone, depth, and structure of my Mathematics Level 10 example.
4. Use two short paragraphs for the Course Description.
5. Include the “What Students Will Learn” section with 3–5 topic areas, each with 3–6 bullet points.
6. Include a “Course Outcomes” section with 4–6 bullet points.
7. Do not add extra sections, headings, commentary, or explanations.
8. Do not shorten or expand the structure — follow the template exactly.
9. Replace all placeholders with content for the specific subject and level provided.
10. Ensure all content is age‑appropriate by following the custom level mapping:

   Level 5 = Year 1
   Level 6 = Year 2
   Level 7 = Year 3
   Level 8 = Year 4
   Level 9 = Year 5
   Level 10 = Year 6
   Level 11 = Year 7
   Level 12 = Year 8
   Level 13 = Year 9
   Level 14 = Year 10
   Level 15 = Year 11 (NCEA Level 1)
   Level 16 = Year 12 (NCEA Level 2)
   Level 17 = Year 13 (NCEA Level 3)
